Significant amendments made to initial evolvinator for purposes of exhibition.

A dramatic amount of functionality has been deprecated in order to have the unit functioning without ethernet connectivity and debug ability, as was the case in the gallery

Optical Density sensing is deprecated due to time constraints foreclosing accurate correlation of cyanobacteria absorbtion rates to the visual density desired for exhibition purposes

Temperature loop is deprecated as cyanobacteria are robust at room temperature

The flow is to be recalibrated based on driving the motor via relay or on board voltage

Ethernet functionality remains intact, but gallery installation did not avail of this function
